## Local Development Setup

To run this project locally with real Appwrite configurations, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `environment.local.ts` inside `src/environments/`.
2. Copy the content from `environment.ts` into `environment.local.ts`.
3. Replace the placeholder values in `environment.local.ts` with your actual Appwrite project keys.
4. Make sure to not commit `environment.local.ts` to the repository. This file is already listed in `.gitignore`.
